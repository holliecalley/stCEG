stCEG is an R-shiny app developed in the first year of my PhD to simplify the process of creating CEGs over spatial areas.

It provides an interactive user interface, along with novel features, such as clickable colouring to express probability judgements, that aren't seen in other comparable software iterations.

Following on from presenting stCEG at the Trees4cat Workshop in October 2024 - a tutorial will be added to this document.
