\title{Compare Two Chain Event Graph Models Using Bayes Factors}
\usage{
compare_ceg_models(summary1, summary2)
}
\arguments{
\item{summary1}{An object of class \code{summary.chain_event_graph}, typically the output of \code{summary()} applied to a fitted CEG model.}

\item{summary2}{Another object of class \code{summary.chain_event_graph} to compare with \code{summary1}.}
}
\value{
An invisible list of class \code{ceg_model_comparison} containing:
\describe{
\item{log_marginal_1}{Log marginal likelihood of model 1.}
\item{log_marginal_2}{Log marginal likelihood of model 2.}
\item{log_Bayes_factor}{The log Bayes factor comparing model 1 to model 2.}
\item{Bayes_factor}{The Bayes factor (on the original scale).}
\item{preferred_model}{The model preferred based on the Bayes factor.}
}
}
\description{
This function compares two fitted Chain Event Graph (CEG) models by evaluating their total log marginal likelihoods and computing the Bayes factor.
The comparison identifies the preferred model and reports the strength of evidence using Jeffreys' scale.
}
\details{
The Bayes factor is calculated as the ratio of marginal likelihoods of the two models: \eqn{BF = \exp(\log BF)}.
Interpretation of the Bayes factor is guided by Jeffreys' scale:
\itemize{
\item \strong{< 1:} Evidence against the alternative model
\item \strong{1–3:} Weak evidence
\item \strong{3–10:} Moderate evidence
\item \strong{10–30:} Strong evidence
\item \strong{30–100:} Very strong evidence
\item \strong{> 100:} Decisive evidence
}

The function prints the log marginal likelihoods, log Bayes factor, Bayes factor, and preferred model.
