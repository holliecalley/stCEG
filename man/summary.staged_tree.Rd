\title{Summarise a Staged Tree Object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{staged_tree}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{staged_tree}, containing components \code{nodes} and \code{edges} in \code{object$stagedtree$x}, and optionally a \code{priortable}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\description{
Provides a visual and textual summary of a staged tree object, including counts of nodes and edges, node colour distributions, and uncoloured nodes in intermediate levels.
}
\details{
This function prints a summary that includes:
\itemize{
\item Total number of nodes and edges.
\item Number of nodes still uncoloured (white) that are not in the first or last level.
\item A count of nodes by hex colour, optionally with coloured terminal output using the \code{crayon} package.
\item The prior table if it exists.
}

If the \code{crayon} package is available, the function displays background colour blocks in the console to represent node colours.
}
\note{
White-coloured nodes (\verb{#FFFFFF}) that are not in the minimum or maximum level are flagged as "Nodes left to be coloured."

\examples{
\dontrun{
staged_tree <- create_staged_tree(data)
